      <h2>Welcome to the Mars Rover Program</h2>
      <p>NASA's Mars Rovers are robotic explorers that help us study the Martian surface and search for signs of past life. Each rover is a marvel of engineering, equipped with scientific instruments to uncover Mars' secrets.</p>
      <p>Over the years, NASA has sent five robotic vehicles, called rovers, to Mars. The names of the five rovers are: Sojourner, Spirit and Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance. The Mars Rover Program is a long-term robotic exploration effort led primarily by NASA, with contributions from other space agencies. Its overarching goals are to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Determine if life ever arose on Mars:</strong> This involves searching for evidence of past or present microbial life, including biosignatures and habitable environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Characterize the climate of Mars:</strong> This includes studying the current climate, its past evolution, and the factors that drive climate change on the planet.</li>
        <li><strong>Characterize the geology of Mars:</strong> This involves understanding the composition, structure, and history of the Martian surface and interior, as well as the processes that have shaped it.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare for human exploration of Mars:</strong> This includes testing technologies, identifying potential resources, and characterizing environmental conditions relevant to future human missions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each robotic explorer sent to the Red Planet has its own unique capabilities driven by science. Many attributes of a rover take on human-like features, such as “heads,” “bodies,” and “arms and legs." Within this website, we will discuss three rovers: Spirit, Opportunity, and Perseverance.</p>
