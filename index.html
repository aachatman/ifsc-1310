  <h2><u>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</u></h2>
<p>Progressive enhancement focuses on creating content that operates sufficiently and effectively across different devices. In progressive enhancement, HTML serves as the fundamental layer that everything else is built.  It ensures that users can access basic content no matter the browser or network. The goal is to ensure that even with no CSS or JavaScript, a user can still read and understand the information and navigate the site or complete essential tasks. It means a stable foundation was created before adding more complex and decorative coding. 
It is important because it enhances accessibility, improves performance, and can ensure universal access.</p>

<h2><u>Mars Rovers Revision and Reflection</u></h2>
<p>There are some things I have been able to retain. For example, flexbox froggy helped me retain some of the terms such as flex-direction, justify-content, and flex wrap. There are a lot of different positions to remember but the repetition of the game helped. Also,the block line and inline elements were very direct. It did not take much to comprehend concepts like headings, paragraphs, list tags, and anchor tags. </p>
<p>What I feel I could still practice on is the box model and CSS positioning. I find myself still having a difficult time determining the dimensions of the boxes and how to correctly position things inside of them. If I could have done things differently, I would have spent more time studying rather than working a lot. Also, I do not feel I have been consistent enough in my structure. It has looked different throughout the semester, and it needs to be improved. </p>
<p>The first feedback I received was regarding the images. The images were not visible. I had to view previous assignments to remember how to insert it in html form. The path with the image link was incorrect, which played a role in the issues as well.  Also, the information was all the same pages and It did not create individual page. </p>
