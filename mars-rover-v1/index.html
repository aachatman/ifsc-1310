      <h2>Welcome to the Mars Rover Program</h2>
      <p>NASA's Mars Rovers are robotic explorers that help us study the Martian surface and search for signs of past life. Each rover is a marvel of engineering, equipped with scientific instruments to uncover Mars' secrets.</p>
      <p>Over the years, NASA has sent five robotic vehicles, called rovers, to Mars. The names of the five rovers are: Sojourner, Spirit and Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance. The Mars Rover Program is a long-term robotic exploration effort led primarily by NASA, with contributions from other space agencies. Its overarching goals are to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Determine if life ever arose on Mars:</strong> This involves searching for evidence of past or present microbial life, including biosignatures and habitable environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Characterize the climate of Mars:</strong> This includes studying the current climate, its past evolution, and the factors that drive climate change on the planet.</li>
        <li><strong>Characterize the geology of Mars:</strong> This involves understanding the composition, structure, and history of the Martian surface and interior, as well as the processes that have shaped it.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare for human exploration of Mars:</strong> This includes testing technologies, identifying potential resources, and characterizing environmental conditions relevant to future human missions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each robotic explorer sent to the Red Planet has its own unique capabilities driven by science. Many attributes of a rover take on human-like features, such as “heads,” “bodies,” and “arms and legs." Within this website, we will discuss three rovers: Spirit, Opportunity, and Perseverance.</p>

        <h3>Spirit</h3>
        <img src="images/spirit.jpg" alt="Spirit rover on Mars" width="400" />
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mission Goals and Overview:</strong> Finding evidence of water on Mars</li>
          <li><strong>Launch and Landing details:</strong> Landed in Gusev Crater, which scientists believed once held water due to ancient river inlets.</li>
          <li><strong>Major discoveries or accomplishments:</strong> Found signs of past water and evidence of volcanic activity, including possible ancient hot springs.</li>
          <li><strong>Challenges and End of Mission:</strong>Spirit faced challenges including a malfunctioning right-front wheel that eventually became an asset for excavating soil. The rover got stuck in soft sand in May 2009. After months of attempts to free it, NASA declared Spirit's mission complete on May 25, 2011, as it was unable to reorient its solar panels to survive the Martian winter. Spirit operated for over six years, far exceeding its planned 90-sol mission, and traveled 4.8 miles (7.73 kilometers).</li>

        <h3>Opportunity</h3>
        <img src="images/opportunity.jpg" alt="Opportunity rover on Mars" width="400" />
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mission Goals and Overview:</strong> Also aimed at finding evidence of water.</li>
          <li><strong>Launch and Landing details:</strong> Landed in Meridiani Planum, a flat and safe landing site.</li>
          <li><strong>Major discoveries or accomplishments:</strong> Found signs of water-rich environments and rocks shaped by past salty seas.</li>
          <li><strong>Challenges and End of Mission:</strong>Opportunity also faced mechanical issues, such as problems with its robotic arm and a wheel that wouldn't steer but would turn. The mission ultimately ended after a severe Mars-wide dust storm in June 2018 blanketed its location, preventing its solar panels from recharging. NASA made its last attempt to contact Opportunity on February 13, 2019, and then declared the mission complete. Opportunity operated for nearly 15 years, traveling over 28 miles (45 kilometers) and vastly exceeding its planned lifespan.</li>
        </ul>
